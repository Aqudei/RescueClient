                <Paragraph  TextAlignment="Justify">
                    Northern Samar, which houses 0.63% of the Philippine population, 
                    has been suffering largely from natural disasters. 
                    It is one of the most disaster-prone region in the country given 
                    the fact that its coasts are facing the Pacific Ocean. Therefore,
                    disaster risk reduction programs and plans should always be in place. 
                    Hence, the need for an improved and more reliable data collection system arises.

                    The Community-Based Risk Response System (CBRRS) in its action to address 
                    the current situation attempts to supply an organized way of collecting 
                    and maintaining information at the local level for use of 
                    Local Government Units, National Government Agencies,
